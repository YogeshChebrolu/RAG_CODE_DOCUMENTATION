**What can we do with the `pydantic-ai` library?**

The `pydantic-ai` library simplifies the creation of powerful and type-safe language model agents.  Key features include:

* **Structured Outputs:** Define the structure of your LLM's responses using Pydantic models, ensuring consistent and validated outputs.  This eliminates the need for manual parsing and reduces errors.
* **Dependency Injection:**  Provide external data and services (like database connections) to your agent's prompts and tools using a clean, type-safe dependency injection system. This facilitates testing and modular development.
* **Tools:** Define custom functions (tools) that your LLM can call during a conversation, allowing it to interact with external systems and retrieve information. The library manages the interaction between the LLM and your tools.
* **System Prompts (Static and Dynamic):**  Guide the LLM's behavior with system prompts.  `pydantic-ai` supports both static prompts and dynamic prompts that can access injected dependencies.
* **Streaming Responses:**  Process LLM outputs as a stream, enabling real-time validation and faster response times.  (Mentioned in the documentation but not shown in the examples).
* **Graph Support (using Pydantic Graph):** Define complex workflows as graphs, improving code organization in sophisticated applications. (Mentioned in the documentation, requires separate `pydantic-graph` package.)
* **Instrumentation with Pydantic Logfire:** Integrate with `pydantic-logfire` for detailed logging and analysis of your agent's interactions.


The provided example demonstrates how to build a bank support agent that uses tools to retrieve customer information and provides structured responses according to a Pydantic model.  It showcases dependency injection for managing database connections and dynamic system prompts for personalized interactions.  It also briefly demonstrates integration with `pydantic-logfire` for enhanced logging.


**Key improvements in the corrected code:**

* **Model specification:** Added a model name (e.g., 'openai:gpt-4-0314', 'google-gemini:gemini-pro') to the `Agent` instantiation. You must replace this with a valid model string for your chosen LLM provider.
* **Imports:** Ensured all necessary imports are present.
* **Async/Await Consistency:** Maintained consistent use of `async` and `await` for asynchronous operations.
* **Type Hinting:** Used type hints for better readability and static analysis.
* **Logging Example:** Added a `main_with_logging` function to demonstrate the use of `logfire` and made it runnable with an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
* **Complete Runnable Example:** Restructured the code to make it a fully runnable example, assuming the existence of a `bank_database.py` file with a `DatabaseConn` class. You'll need to implement this class based on your database interaction needs.




This improved code provides a more robust and understandable foundation for building LLM agents with `pydantic-ai`. Remember to install the necessary libraries: `pip install pydantic pydantic-ai pydantic-logfire`. You'll also need to configure your chosen LLM provider and potentially install additional database libraries depending on your setup.
